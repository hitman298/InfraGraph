InfraGraph
InfraGraph is a modern, interactive tool for designing cloud architecture diagrams. It is built using React Flow, Framer Motion, and Vite. The application enables users to visually design infrastructure components, modify their properties, estimate costs, and export the complete layout.

Delete nodes by selecting a component and pressing the Delete key.

A Quick Add Button is available below the canvas for rapid component creation.

The Zoom to Fit button automatically centers the entire canvas view.
